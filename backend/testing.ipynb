Equation (4.6) is called a recursive state estimator because it computes the new belief STATE ESTIMATION RECURSIVE state from the previous one rather than by examining the entire percept sequence. If the agent is not to “fall behind,” the computation has to happen as fast as percepts are coming in. As the environment becomes more complex, the exact update computation becomes infeasible and the agent will have to compute an approximate belief state, perhaps focusing on the im- plications of the percept for the aspects of the environment that are of current interest. Most work on this problem has been done for stochastic, continuous-state environments with the tools of probability theory, as explained in Chapter 15. Here we will show an example in a discrete environment with detrministic sensors and nondeterministic actions.', 'Alpha–Beta Pruning',

'Introduction', '1', 5, 22, 'The challenge here is to understand how the genes and samples are or- ganized. Typical questions include the following: (a) which samples are most similar to each other, in terms of their expres- sion proﬁles across genes? (b) which genes are most similar to each other, in terms of their expression proﬁles across samples? (c) do certain genes show very high (or low) expression for certain cancer samples? We could view this task as a regression problem, with two categorical predictor variables—genes and samples—with the response variable being the level of expression. However, it is probably more useful to view it as unsupervised learning problem. For example, for question (a) above, we think of the samples as points in 6830–dimensional space, which we want to cluster together in some way.', 'Null',

The following simple analogy is very helpful. How do you represent all the real num- bers between 1 and 2? After all, there are an inﬁnite number of them! The answer is to use an interval representation that just speciﬁes the boundaries of the set: [1,2]. It works because we have an ordering on the real numbers.', 'Summary, Bibliographical and Historical Notes, Exercises',
