A linear equation is just a series of terms and mathematical operations where some terms are unknown; for example: y = 4 × x + 1 (1.1) Equations like this are linear in that they describe a line on a two-dimensional graph. The line comes from plugging in diﬀerent values into the unknown x to ﬁnd out what the equation or model does to the value of y. We can line up a system of equations with the same form with two or more unknowns; for example: y = 0.1 × x1 + 0.4 × x2 y = 0.3 × x1 + 0.9 × x2 y = 0.2 × x1 + 0.3 × x2 · · · (1.2) The column of y values can be taken as a column vector of outputs from the equation. The two columns of integer values are the data columns, say a1 and a2, and can be taken as a matrix A. The two unknown values x1 and x2 can be taken as the coeﬃcients of the equation and together form a vector of unknowns b to be solved. We can write this compactly using linear algebra notation as: y = A · b (1.3) Problems of this form are generally challenging to solve because there are more unknowns (here we have 2) than there are equations to solve (here we have 3). Further, there is often no single line that can satisfy all of the equations without error. Systems describing problems we are often interested in (such as a linear regression) can have an inﬁnite number of solutions.",Extensions

It is an approach that can simplify more complex matrix operations that can be performed on the decomposed matrix rather than on the original matrix itself. A common analogy for matrix decomposition is the factoring of numbers, such as the factoring of 10 into 2 × 5. For this reason, matrix decomposition is also called matrix factorization. Like factoring real values, there are 109 many ways to decompose a matrix, hence there are a range of diﬀerent matrix decomposition techniques.
